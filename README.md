# PasswordAnalyzer



This is a simple C program I developed for analyzing the strength of passwords. It checks various aspects of a password, including its length, the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits. The program provides feedback based on these checks to help users understand the strength of their password.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you will need a C compiler installed on your system. If you don't have one already, you can install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on most Linux distributions. On Windows, you can use MinGW or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports C programming.

## Usage

1. When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a password.

2. After entering the password, the program will ask you to re-enter it to confirm.

3. The program will then analyze the password and provide feedback based on the following criteria:

   - **Length**: Password should be between 8 and 15 characters.
   - **Uppercase Letters**: Password should contain at least one uppercase letter.
   - **Lowercase Letters**: Password should contain at least one lowercase letter.
   - **Digits**: Password should contain at least one digit.

4. The program will display whether your password meets these criteria or not.

5. You will receive feedback on each criterion, and it will let you know if your password needs improvement.
